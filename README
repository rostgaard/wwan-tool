Ericsson F3507g Mobile Broadband Module

TODO
----
  * Enable Tasking
  * Extend the procedure, so they can react to error conditions
  * Make the inputs of the program more robust with an internal timeout and regexp
  * Make the program take command line arguments (Ada.Command_Line)
  * Daemonize the program (optional)
  * Make a call-home feature (check if there is internet already) 
  * Implement the scanning functions
  * Build a html form/ssh server that receives the reports - or, send sms'
  * Enable the anti-theft feature to be enabled from sms

Bugs
----
  * The modem sometimes return NO CARRIER to commands, why?
